# Categorise Web Client

![Continuous Deployment](https://github.com/ALRobilliard/categorise-web-client/workflows/Continuous%20Deployment/badge.svg)

This is a React SPA for use with my [Categorise API](https://github.com/ALRobilliard/CategoriseApi).

Once complete, the App will provide functionality for tracking personal spending, with the ability to:
- Bulk upload transactions from CSV files
- Categorise individual transactions on upload
- Create and maintain a list of transaction mappings, for automatic categorisation
- Re-extract stored transactions
- Add tags to transactions
